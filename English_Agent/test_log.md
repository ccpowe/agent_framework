### **V1.3 Test Analysis**

**Overall Pass Rate: 59.6%**

This is a significant improvement from 36.8% and demonstrates that the v1.2 code and prompt fixes were successful in resolving the critical "Stalemate Loop." All tests now complete without timing out.

The remaining 23 failures highlight the final layer of complexity. The root cause is no longer technical but strategic: the single `english_agent` is suffering from **Rule Conflict and Over-Correction**. It struggles to apply a large, complex set of rules simultaneously, leading to inconsistent results.

---

### **Key Failure Categories:**

1.  **Capitalization Conflict:** The agent correctly fixes one error but incorrectly re-corrects or fails to correct capitalization in the same pass.
    *   **Example:** `My freind...` becomes `my[My] freind...` (Incorrectly "fixes" `My`).
    *   **Example:** `Me and him...` becomes `me[I] and him[he]...` (Fails to capitalize the first word `me`).

2.  **Punctuation Errors:** The agent either misses required punctuation tags or incorrectly tags existing, correct punctuation.
    *   **Example:** `what is your name` becomes `...name<?>`. It correctly identifies the question but fails to use the required `<.>` tag for a missing punctuation mark.
    *   **Example:** `If I was rich, ...` becomes `...rich<,>...`. It incorrectly adds a tag to a comma that was already correct.

3.  **Structural vs. Simple Fixes:** The agent defaults to the simplest fix (like adding `<.>`) instead of identifying deeper structural problems that require a full sentence rewrite with `{}`.

---

### **Conclusion & Next Steps**

We have reached the performance limit of a single-agent approach. Simply adding more rules to the prompt will likely increase confusion and yield diminishing returns.

The clear path forward is to **refactor the architecture into a multi-agent "assembly line"**:

1.  **`Spelling_and_Grammar_Agent`**: Handles only `[]` corrections.
2.  **`Punctuation_Agent`**: Handles only `<>` corrections.
3.  **`Structural_Agent`**: Handles only `{}` corrections.

This division of labor will give each agent a simpler, more focused prompt, drastically reducing rule conflicts and leading to a more robust and accurate system. This architectural change is the necessary next step to surpass the 90% pass rate goal.
