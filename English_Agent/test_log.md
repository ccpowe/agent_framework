  High-Level Analysis: The Good and The Bad


   * The Good News: The overall pass rate jumped from 36.8% to 57.9%. More importantly, the "Stalemate Loop"
     is completely gone. Every test that ran now finishes in just 1 or 2 iterations. This is a huge success
     and proves the code fix and the check_agent prompt are working perfectly. We are no longer fighting the
     system; we are now purely focused on the english_agent's accuracy.


   * The Bad News: With the stalemate gone, we now have a crystal-clear view of the english_agent's remaining
     weaknesses. The failures are no longer due to timeouts but are actual mistakes made by the correction
     agent.

  After a thorough review of the 24 failed tests, I've identified three new, distinct categories of errors.

  ---

  Problem Identification & Root Cause Analysis


  Issue #1: Hallucinated or Invalid Markup (Critical)

  This is the most frequent new issue. The agent is "inventing" new, incorrect ways to apply the markup
  rules, especially when multiple corrections are needed on the same word or in the same area.


   * What is happening? Instead of applying the simple word[correction] or <,> tags, it's creating bizarre
     combinations.
   * Supporting Evidence:
       * article_errors: a honest[an honest] person (Incorrectly grouped words)
       * punctuation_errors: Hello[Hello<,>] (Tried to nest a tag within a tag)
       * structural_problems: skills[,] (Invented a new tag format)
   * Root Cause: The prompt defines what the agent should do, but it doesn't explicitly forbid these
     "creative" but invalid combinations. The agent, trying to be efficient, is incorrectly merging steps.

  Issue #2: Inconsistent Rule Application (The "Close, but no Cigar" problem)

  The agent often fixes the most obvious error in a sentence but fails to apply all necessary corrections.


   * What is happening? It will fix a spelling error but miss the capitalization on the same word, or fix a
     verb but miss adding the final period.
   * Supporting Evidence:
       * capitalization_errors: Corrected what is your name to what[What] is your name<?> but failed to also
         add the period tag <.> as the original had no punctuation. It correctly identified it as a question,
         but the markup for the final punctuation was missing.
       * pronoun_errors: Corrected Me and him... to me[I] and him[he].... It correctly identified that "Me"
         should be "I", but it failed to capitalize the first word of the sentence (me[I] instead of Me[I]).
       * subject_verb_agreement: For The data suggest..., it produced ✅ No errors found., completely ignoring
          the explicit example in its instructions.
   * Root Cause: The "Step 4: Final Verification" we added was a good step, but it's not forceful enough. The
     agent is still not being methodical enough in checking its own work against every rule.


  Issue #3: Unwanted Conversational Output or Formatting

  In a few cases, the agent broke character and produced output that wasn't the raw, corrected text.


   * What is happening? It's adding its "thought process" or markdown formatting to the final output.
   * Supporting Evidence:
       * subjunctive_mood: It outputted **Internal Thought Process**: ... **Output**: ... instead of just the
         corrected string.
       * structural_problems: It wrapped its output in a markdown code block:  ``{...}`` .
   * Root Cause: This is a classic LLM behavior where the agent "leaks" its internal monologue or follows the
     format of the examples too literally (including the "Internal Thought Process" headers). We need to add a
      strict instruction to only output the final, corrected string.

❌ 测试失败
反馈: **Evaluation:**

1. The original text "Hello how are you today" has two errors:
   - Missing comma after "Hello" (should be "Hello,").
   - Missing question mark (should be "you today?").

2. The `corrected_text` **does not actually fix these errors**—it only adds `<?>` at the end, which is not a valid way to mark punctuation corrections. Proper markup would require:
   - `Hello[Hello,] how are you today[?]`

3. The original text was **not already correct**, so simply appending `<?>` is insufficient.

**REJECTED:** The markup is improperly applied—errors remain unfixed (`<?>` is not valid standalone correction syntax). Corrections must be direct (e.g., `today[?]`).

*(Note: If the responder had claimed no errors with "✅ No errors found," that would also be wrong—the original text did contain errors.)*
