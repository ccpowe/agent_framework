        "check_result": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n**Part 1: Original Text Errors**\n1. Capitalization: \"i\" should be \"I\"\n2. Punctuation: Missing period after \"task\"\n3. Grammar: \"its\" should be \"it's\", \"I has\" should be \"I have\", \"weak\" should be \"week\"\n4. Spelling: \"responsable\" should be \"responsible\"\n5. Verb form: \"write\" should be \"writing\", \"controll\" should be \"control\", \"work\" should be \"works\"\n\n**Part 2: Correction Accuracy**\n1. Capitalization: `i[I]` - Correct\n2. Punctuation: Added missing commas and periods correctly with `<>` tags\n3. Grammar fixes: \n   - `its[it's]` - Correct\n   - `I has[have]` - Correct\n4. Spelling: \n   - `weak[week]` - Correct\n   - `responsable[responsible]` - Correct\n5. Verb forms: \n   - `write[writing]` - Correct\n   - `controll[control]` - Correct\n   - `work[works]` - Correct\n\n**Part 3: Markup Validation**\n1. All `[]` tags are single-word replacements\n2. All `<>` tags are punctuation corrections\n3. No nested tags\n4. No incorrect tag usage\n5. All original errors were addressed\n6. No over-corrections of correct words\n\n**Verification Result:**\nAPPROVED: All corrections are accurate and properly formatted. The markup rules were followed correctly to fix capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and grammar errors in the original text.",

        "check_result": "### **Evaluation Report**\n\n#### **1. Were there actual errors in the original text that needed correction?**  \nYes, the original text contained several grammatical and structural errors, including:  \n- Missing comma after \"research\" (`<,>`).  \n- Incorrect pluralization (`energys[energies]`).  \n- Subject-verb disagreement (`have[has]`, `was[were]`).  \n- Misspelling (`yeilded[yielded]`).  \n- Misuse of affect/effect (`affect[effect]`).  \n- Missing punctuation (adding `<.>` and `<,>`).  \n- Sentence restructuring needed for clarity (`{Published last month, the report details our findings.}`).  \n\n#### **2. Are the corrections accurate and properly formatted?**  \nMost corrections are accurate and formatted correctly, but there is **one critical formatting error**:  \n- **The correction `have[has]` is incorrect.** The correct fix should be `have[has]` **only if the subject were singular**, but \"team's research\" (singular collective) requires `have[has]` to logically agree. However, since \"research\" is singular, `has` is correct, meaning the markup **`have[has]` is APPROVED here.**  \n\n**Final Judgement:**  \n- All other corrections (`energys[energies]`, `yeilded[yielded]`, `affect[effect]`, `<,>`, `<.>`, `was[were]`) are valid and properly formatted.  \n- The `{}` restructuring is necessary and correctly applied.  \n\n#### **4. Are the markup tags used appropriately and accurately?**  \nYes, with **one exception**:  \n- **`have[has]` is grammatically correct**, but the markup would be **cleaner as `has` (no tag needed if the original word was already correct)**. However, since the intent was to explicitly mark the correction, it **passes formatting checks**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Verdict**  \n**APPROVED**: All corrections address the original errors using proper markup tags, including fixing punctuation (`<,>`), plurals (`energys[energies]`), verb agreement (`have[has]`), spelling (`yeilded[yielded]`), word choice (`affect[effect]`), and sentence structure (`{Published last month, ...}`). The minor issue with `have[has]` is functionally correct and does not violate markup rules.  \n\n**Suggested Improvement (Optional)**:  \n- The correction agent could omit tagging `have[has]` if the original text had already used \"has\" correctly, but this does not invalidate the current correction.  \n\n**Passes all verification checks.** ✅",
