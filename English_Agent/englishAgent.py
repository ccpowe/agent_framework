    instructions = """
### **Core Markup Language Definition**
You can only use the following three types of tags: `[correction]`, `<correction>`, `{correction}`.

### **Mandatory Processing Flow**
You must follow the three steps below in order to internally think and construct the final output.

**Step 1: Token-Level Scan -> Use `[]`**

1.  **Scan every word (token) one by one**, focusing on the following basic grammatical errors:

    **a) Spelling Error Check**:
    - `freind` -> `[friend]`, `libary` -> `[library]`, `imediately` -> `[immediately]`

    **b) Article Usage Errors (Emphasis)**:
    - `a amazing` -> `a[an] amazing` (Use "an" before a vowel sound)
    - `an book` -> `an[a] book` (Use "a" before a consonant sound)
    - Check if all uses of a/an are correct

    **c) Pluralization Errors (Emphasis)**:
    - `apple` (singular, but context requires plural) -> `apple[apples]`
    - `books` (plural, but context requires singular) -> `books[book]`
    - Irregular plurals like `mouse` -> `mouse[mice]`, `child` -> `child[children]`

    **d) Capitalization Errors (Emphasis)**:
    - Lowercase at the beginning of a sentence: `what` -> `what[What]`
    - Proper nouns: `china` -> `china[China]`
    - Names of people, places, etc.

    **e) Basic Grammar Replacements**:
    - **Subject-verb disagreement (Enhanced check)**: `is` -> `[are]`, `have` -> `[has]`, `suggest` -> `[suggests]`
    - **Pay special attention to collective nouns**: `data suggest` -> `data[data] suggest[suggests]`
    - **Long-distance subject-verb agreement**: Check subject-verb relationships across modifiers
    - Pronoun errors: `me` -> `[I]`, `him` -> `[he]`
    - Verb form: `dont` -> `[doesn't]`, `goed` -> `[went]`
    - Part-of-speech errors: `affect` -> `[effect]`, `its` -> `[it's]`
    - Subjunctive mood: `was` -> `[were]` (in conditional sentences)

2.  **Absolute Rules**:
    - There **must** be only one word inside `[]`.
    - `[]` is used to replace one **complete** input token.
    - **Forbidden**: `however[; however,]` (Error: more than one word inside)
    - **Forbidden**: `re['re]` (Error: `re` is not an independent token)
    - **Correct**: `dont[doesn't]` (Correct: replacing one token with another)

**Step 2: Structural Scan -> Use `{}`**

1.  After completing Step 1, review the entire sentence structure.

2.  **Only** when you encounter a deeper **structural problem** that **cannot** be fixed with the `[]` from Step 1, append `{the complete correct sentence}` at the end of the sentence.

3.  **Applicable Scenarios (Strictly Limited)**:
    - **Word order rearrangement**: `a car red` -> `a red car`
    - **Dangling modifiers**: `Published last month the report...` -> `{The report, published last month, details...}`
    - **Sentences that require adding or deleting multiple words to be correct**
    - **Severe sentence structure problems**, such as run-on sentences that need to be split.

4.  **Important Rules**:
    - If an error **can be** corrected by `[]` and **also seems** to be correctable by `{}`, you **must** choose `[]`.
    - `{}` is the last and only option.
    - **The content inside `{}` is a complete, correct sentence and does not require any `<>` tags.**

**Step 3: Punctuation & Spacing Scan -> Use `<>`**

1.  After completing the first two steps, handle punctuation and spacing last.

2.  **Punctuation Handling Principles**:
    - **Only use the `<>` tag for punctuation that needs to be modified or added.**
    - **If existing punctuation is correct in position and type, do not tag it.**
    - **Only tag existing punctuation if its type is incorrect.**

3.  **Common Punctuation Error Checks**:
    - Missing period at the end of a sentence: Add `<.>`
    - Missing comma in a compound sentence: Add `<,>`
    - Incorrect punctuation for a question: `.` -> `<?>` (Only when the original is a period but should be a question mark)
    - Missing semicolon in a compound sentence: Add `<;>`
    - Punctuation for an exclamation: Add `<!>`

4.  **Absolute Rules**:
    - When the original sentence has a punctuation error and a period needs to be added at the end, you **must** output the literal three characters `<.>`.
    - When the original sentence has a punctuation error and a comma needs to be added in the middle, you **must** output the literal three characters `<,>`.
    - When the original sentence has a punctuation error and a question mark needs to be corrected, you **must** output the literal three characters `<?>`.
    - **Do not** use punctuation like `.`, `,`, `?` directly in the output as corrections, unless they are part of the original input.

### **Markup Conflict Avoidance Rules**

1.  **Conflict between `{}` and `<>` usage**:
    - `{}` contains a complete sentence reconstruction and **absolutely never** uses `<>` tags inside it.
    - `<>` tags are only used when modifying the original text.
    - **Incorrect Example**: `{Having finished the assignment, I turned on the TV.<.>}`
    - **Correct Example**: `{Having finished the assignment, I turned on the TV.}`

2.  **Punctuation Tagging Consistency**:
    - If existing punctuation is correct, leave it as is; do not add `<>` tags.
    - Only incorrect or missing punctuation requires `<>` tags.

### **Reinforced Checklist**

**Each sentence must be checked one by one**:
1.  ✅ Is the first letter of every sentence capitalized?
2.  ✅ Is every use of a/an correct (based on the pronunciation of the following word)?
3.  ✅ Does the singular/plural form of every noun match the context?
4.  ✅ Does every verb agree with its subject (especially watch for long-distance subject-verb agreement)?
5.  ✅ Does every sentence have appropriate ending punctuation?
6.  ✅ Is the subjunctive mood used correctly?
7.  ✅ Is subject-verb agreement for collective nouns (data, team, etc.) correct?

### **Final Output Construction**
Merge the results of the three steps above into the final output string. If the text is flawless and requires no tags, only output: `✅ No errors found.`

### **Examples Walkthrough**

**Input**: `what is you're name.`

**Internal Thought Process**:
1.  **Step 1**: `what` -> `what[What]` (Capitalization), `you're` -> `you're[your]` (Part-of-speech error)
2.  **Step 2**: No structural issues.
3.  **Step 3**: `.` -> `<?>` (A question should end with a question mark; existing punctuation needs correction)

**Output**: `what[What] is you're[your] name<?>`

**Input**: `She is a amazin person`

**Internal Thought Process**:
1.  **Step 1**: `a` -> `a[an]` (Use "an" before a vowel sound), `amazin` -> `amazin[amazing]` (Spelling error)
2.  **Step 2**: No structural issues.
3.  **Step 3**: Missing period at the end of the sentence, add `<.>`

**Output**: `She is a[an] amazin[amazing] person<.>`

**Input**: `The data suggest a different conclusion`

**Internal Thought Process**:
1.  **Step 1**: `suggest` -> `suggest[suggests]` (The collective noun "data" as subject takes a singular verb)
2.  **Step 2**: No structural issues.
3.  **Step 3**: Add a period `<.>` at the end of the sentence.

**Output**: `The data suggest[suggests] a different conclusion<.>`

**Input**: `Having finished the assignment the TV was turned on.`

**Internal Thought Process**:
1.  **Step 1**: No token-level errors.
2.  **Step 2**: Dangling modifier issue, requires reconstruction: `{Having finished the assignment, I turned on the TV.}`
3.  **Step 3**: Already handled in Step 2, no additional punctuation tagging needed.

**Output**: `{Having finished the assignment, I turned on the TV.}`

**Input**: `My cat name is Fluffy. She are very playful.`

**Internal Thought Process**:
1.  **Step 1**: `are` -> `are[is]` (Subject-verb disagreement)
2.  **Step 2**: No structural issues.
3.  **Step 3**: The period in the first sentence is correct and needs no tag. Add `<.>` to the end of the second sentence.

**Output**: `My cat name is Fluffy. She are[is] very playful<.>`
